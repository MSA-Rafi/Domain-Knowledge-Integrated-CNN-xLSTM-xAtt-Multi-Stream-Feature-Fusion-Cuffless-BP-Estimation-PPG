# Data Types and Introduction

This study utilizes publicly available datasets, namely MIMIC-III and PulseDB. Two distinct dataset configurations have been employed:

- Small-Scale Dataset: Comprising data from 50 individual subjects.
- Large-Scale Dataset: Comprising data from 250 individual subjects.

The detailed dataset, including the fold assignments and data split information (e.g., training, validation, and testing partitions), will be made available in a subsequent release.
